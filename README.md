# IMDB Sentiment Analysis with Simple RNN

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. The Dataset is directly imported from the tensorflow official website.

**Functionality:**

* Loads and preprocesses the IMDB dataset.
* Builds and trains a Simple RNN model for sentiment classification.
* Evaluates the model's performance.
* Saves and loads the trained model.
* Provides a function to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews.


**Key Features:**

* Uses an Embedding layer to represent words as vectors.
* Employs a Simple RNN layer to capture sequential information in text.
* Includes a Dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
* Achieves reasonable accuracy on sentiment prediction.
